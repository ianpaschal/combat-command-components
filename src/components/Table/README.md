# Table

The `<Table />` component is a minimalist, scrollable table to provide a level of organization above what simple stack/list would.

This component behaves like a table embedded in a document, rather than a spreadsheet.
There is no horizontal scrolling.
The features are similar to what you would find in a Markdown table or on Confluence:

- Set explicit column widths; Unset columns are evenly divided among remaining space.
- Set column alignment, defaults to `left`.
- Default rendering for text and numbers, or via custom `render()` method.
